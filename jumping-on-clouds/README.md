#Jumping on the Clouds

Playing a game where you can jump between clouds that are represented by 0. Clouds represented by 1 are no-go clouds. You can only jump between clouds that are either 1 or 2 greater than the current cloud you are sitting on. 

Write a method that takes int[] representing the clouds(0,1). This function will return the shortest distance from start to finish. 

Example 1:

__Input__ [0,0,1,0,0,1,0] 

__Output__ 4

Example 2:

__Input__ [0,0,0,0,1,0]

__Output__ 3
